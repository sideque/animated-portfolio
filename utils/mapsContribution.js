    If we look over India's Map
    there're actually very few 360
    Street View blue lines over the
    map, and as I live in Kannur
    there So I added 360 map view of
    the main areas of Kannur which
    helped a lot of people I
    successfully covered more than
    500 KM of 360 View of Kannur
    which is actually the most 360
    GSV's contribution in India.
    and it already got Millions of
    views in really less time.
